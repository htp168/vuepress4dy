In addition to exceptional innovation and competitive pricing, we offer our OEM customers the full benefit of our outstanding technological expertise :
We offer class-leading longevity in the OEM compressor field, thanks to our very tight manufacturing tolerances.
We manufacture oil-free scroll compressors with brushless DC (BLDC) motor drives/controllers.
Our core technology is the rocking piston principle, which has been part of our product line since the company started.
We offer ‘engineered design’ from the ground up, and we know which pump unit is best suited to your application.
